<h2 id="arbitration-and-dispute-resolution">6. ARBITRATION AND DISPUTE
RESOLUTION</h2>
<p>6.1. <strong>Binding Arbitration.</strong> Any dispute arising from
these Terms shall be resolved exclusively through binding arbitration,
except that either party may seek equitable relief in any court of
competent jurisdiction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>In Plain Language:</strong> If we have a disagreement about
these Terms, we’ll resolve it through arbitration (a private dispute
resolution process) instead of going to court. The only exception is if
either of us needs immediate court help to stop ongoing harm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>6.2. <strong>Arbitration Process.</strong> Arbitration shall be
conducted in Delaware, pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration
Association (AAA) or JAMS. The arbitration award will be final and
binding.</p>
<p>6.3. <strong>Opt-Out Option.</strong> You have the right to opt out
of arbitration by notifying SHMONG in writing at Legal@shmong.com, or
sending written notice to our Delaware address within 60 days of
accepting these Terms. If you opt-out, all disputes will be resolved in
accordance with the laws of Delaware and subject to the appropriate
courts, rather than through arbitration. The written notice must clearly
state your intent to opt-out of arbitration.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>In Plain Language:</strong> You can choose not to participate
in arbitration if you tell us in writing within 60 days of agreeing to
these terms. If you opt out, any disputes would go through regular
courts instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>6.4. <strong>Class Action Waiver.</strong> You agree that disputes
will be resolved on an individual basis only, not as part of a class
action. You waive any right to participate in class actions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>In Plain Language:</strong> By using our service, you agree
to handle any disputes with us one-on-one, not as part of a group
lawsuit.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="choice-of-law-and-venue">7. CHOICE OF LAW AND VENUE</h2>
<p>7.1. <strong>Choice of Law.</strong> These Terms shall be governed by
Delaware law, without regard to conflicts of law principles.</p>
<p>7.2. <strong>Venue.</strong> Disputes not subject to arbitration
shall be resolved exclusively in Delaware courts. You agree to submit to
the personal jurisdiction of such courts.</p>
<h2 id="indemnification">8. INDEMNIFICATION</h2>
<p>8.1. <strong>User Indemnification.</strong> You agree to defend,
indemnify, and hold harmless SHMONG from any claims, liabilities,
damages, losses, costs, or fees arising from your violation of these
Terms, your Content (including lack of consent), or violation of
third-party rights.</p>
<h2 id="limitation-of-liability">9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>
<p>9.1. <strong>“AS IS” Basis.</strong> THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS
IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE,” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND.</p>
<p>9.2. <strong>Limitation of Liability.</strong> TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY LAW, SHMONG SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT,
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM
YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES.</p>
<p>9.3. <strong>Cap on Liability.</strong> SHMONG’s total liability for
all claims arising under these Terms shall be limited to the amount you
paid to SHMONG in the last 12 months prior to the claim. This limitation
applies regardless of the basis of any liability claim and regardless of
the form of action.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>In Plain Language:</strong> If something goes wrong, we’ll
only be responsible for refunding what you’ve paid us in the past year.
This limit applies no matter what type of legal claim might be
involved.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="modification-of-terms">10. MODIFICATION OF TERMS</h2>
<p>10.1. <strong>Changes to Terms.</strong> SHMONG reserves the right to
modify these Terms of Service at any time. For material changes to these
Terms: - We will provide at least 30 days’ notice before the changes
take effect - Notice will be provided through email (for registered
users) and prominent notice on our website - We will highlight
significant changes and provide a summary of modifications - For
non-material changes, updates may take effect immediately upon
posting</p>
<p>10.2. <strong>Acceptance of Modified Terms.</strong> After the notice
period, your continued use of the Services constitutes acceptance of the
modified Terms. If you do not agree to the updated terms, you must stop
using the Services and terminate your account.</p>
<p>10.3. <strong>Prior Versions.</strong> We will maintain an archive of
previous versions of these Terms for your reference.</p>
<h2 id="general-provisions">11. GENERAL PROVISIONS</h2>
<p>11.1. <strong>Severability.</strong> If a provision is unenforceable,
it will be limited or eliminated minimally; the rest remains in
effect.</p>
<p>11.2. <strong>Assignment.</strong> You cannot assign Terms without
SHMONG’s consent; SHMONG may assign freely.</p>

entire agreement, superseding prior agreements.</p>

<p>1.6. <strong>Uploader Responsibility.</strong> If you upload content
containing other individuals, you are solely and exclusively responsible
for obtaining their written consent, notifying them of this policy, and
documenting their acceptance as specified in the Terms of Service.
SHMONG’s role is limited to requiring uploaders to certify they have
obtained proper consent before uploading biometric data.</p>
<p>1.7. <strong>Certification of Consent by Uploaders.</strong> Before
uploading any Content containing biometric data of other individuals,
you must certify that: - You have obtained express, informed written
consent from each identifiable individual - You have informed these
individuals that their biometric data will be processed by SHMONG - You
maintain verifiable records of these consents - You take full legal
responsibility for the consent collection process - You will indemnify
SHMONG against any claims arising from inadequate consent</p>
<p>1.8. <strong>Mandatory Certification Checkbox.</strong> SHMONG
implements a mandatory certification process requiring uploaders to
affirmatively check a box before each upload containing biometric data,
specifically certifying they have obtained all necessary consents. This
checkbox is non-optional, and uploads cannot proceed without this
certification. SHMONG maintains records of these certifications,
including timestamps and user information. However, SHMONG does not
independently verify the actual consent documents and relies entirely on
uploader certifications.</p>
<p>1.9. <strong>SHMONG’s Limited Role in Consent Process.</strong>
SHMONG’s role regarding consent is limited to: - Requiring uploaders to
certify they have obtained proper consent - Providing uploaders with
information about consent requirements - Establishing a mechanism for
certification during the upload process - Maintaining records of
uploader certifications SHMONG does not verify the actual consent
documents obtained by uploaders and relies entirely on uploader
certifications regarding consent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>In Plain Language:</strong> If you upload photos of other
people to our service: - You must check a box confirming you have their
permission - You are responsible for actually getting their written
permission - We keep a record of your certification but don’t check the
actual permission forms - We trust that when you check the box, you’ve
truly gotten proper permission - You are legally responsible if you
upload someone’s face without proper permission</p>
</blockquote>
<p>1.10. <strong>Consent Verification and Audit Program.</strong> To
ensure the integrity of our consent certification system: - SHMONG
conducts periodic random audits of uploader consent records to verify
compliance - Selected uploaders must provide verifiable evidence of
proper consent within 10 business days - Uploaders agree to participate
in these audits as a condition of using our Services - Audits will
assess both the existence and validity of consent records - SHMONG will
maintain detailed records of all audit processes and findings - Audit
frequency will be determined based on risk assessment and usage
volume</p>
<p>1.11. <strong>Consequences of Audit Failure.</strong> Failure to
comply with audit requirements or discovery of consent violations may
result in: - Immediate account suspension pending investigation -
Permanent account termination for serious or repeated violations -
Removal of all Content uploaded without proper consent documentation -
Prohibition from creating new accounts on the platform - Potential
reporting to relevant regulatory authorities - Legal action for
indemnification as provided in the Terms of Service - Additional
remedial measures as required to ensure compliance</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>In Plain Language:</strong> - We will randomly check if
uploaders actually have the permission forms they claimed to have - If
selected for audit, you must show us the permission documents within 10
business days - If you can’t prove you had permission or you’ve falsely
claimed to have permission, we may suspend or terminate your account,
remove your content, ban you from our platform, report you to
authorities, and/or take legal action against you</p>
