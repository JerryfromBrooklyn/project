1.8. **Mandatory Certification Checkbox.** SHMONG implements a mandatory certification process requiring uploaders to affirmatively check a box before each upload containing biometric data, specifically certifying they have obtained all necessary consents. This checkbox is non-optional, and uploads cannot proceed without this certification. SHMONG maintains records of these certifications, including timestamps and user information. However, SHMONG does not independently verify the actual consent documents and relies entirely on uploader certifications.

1.9. **SHMONG's Limited Role in Consent Process.** SHMONG's role regarding consent is limited to:
   - Requiring uploaders to certify they have obtained proper consent
   - Providing uploaders with information about consent requirements
   - Establishing a mechanism for certification during the upload process
   - Maintaining records of uploader certifications
   SHMONG does not verify the actual consent documents obtained by uploaders and relies entirely on uploader certifications regarding consent.

> **In Plain Language:** If you upload photos of other people to our service:
> - You must check a box confirming you have their permission
> - You are responsible for actually getting their written permission
> - We keep a record of your certification but don't check the actual permission forms
> - We trust that when you check the box, you've truly gotten proper permission
> - You are legally responsible if you upload someone's face without proper permission

1.10. **Consent Verification and Audit Program.** To ensure the integrity of our consent certification system:
   - SHMONG conducts periodic random audits of uploader consent records to verify compliance
   - Selected uploaders must provide verifiable evidence of proper consent within 10 business days
