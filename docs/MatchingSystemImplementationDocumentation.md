# Shmong Face Matching System - Complete Implementation Guide

## 1. System Overview

The Shmong face matching system is an AWS-based facial recognition platform. Users register their faces and can discover photos containing them, either uploaded by themselves or others. The system uses AWS Rekognition for face detection, indexing, and matching, DynamoDB for data storage, and S3 for photo storage. A comprehensive trash system allows users to hide photos from their view without permanent deletion, and an enhanced image viewer provides interactive photo viewing on both desktop and mobile devices.

### 1.1 Core Functionality

*   **User Registration:** Users register with email, password, and a facial scan
*   **Photo Upload:** Users can upload photos through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface
*   **Face Indexing:** System detects faces in uploaded photos and indexes them
*   **Historical Matching:** When users register, a *background task* searches existing photos for matches
*   **Future Matching:** New photo uploads are automatically matched against registered users
*   **Dashboard View:** Central hub with tabs for Home (user info, registration), Matches, Upload, and Trash
*   **My Photos View:** Displays photos where the user has been matched
*   **Uploads View:** Displays photos uploaded by the user
*   **Enhanced Image Viewer:** Full-screen viewer with zoom, rotation, and download capabilities
*   **Trash System:** Allows soft-deletion (hiding) of photos from either the "My Photos" or "Uploads" view, with options to restore or permanently hide
*   **Mobile Optimization:** Responsive design with touch-friendly controls for mobile users

### 1.2 Key Technical Components

*   **AWS Rekognition:** Powers face detection, storage, and matching
*   **AWS DynamoDB:** Stores user data, photo metadata, face matching relationships, and photo visibility status
*   **AWS S3:** Stores uploaded photos
*   **AWS Lambda:** Processes background tasks for matching and indexing
*   **React Frontend:** Provides user interface (Dashboard, MyPhotos, PhotoManager, PhotoGrid, TrashBin, etc.)
*   **TailwindCSS:** Provides consistent, responsive styling
*   **Framer Motion:** Powers smooth animations and transitions
*   **React Dropzone:** Enables drag-and-drop file uploads
*   **Lucide Icons:** Provides consistent iconography throughout the app

### 2.2 The Prefix System Explained

The face matching system uses a prefix system to distinguish between user faces and faces detected in photos:

* **User faces:** Indexed with prefix `user_[userId]`
  * Example: `user_abc123` for user with ID abc123
  
* **Photo faces:** Indexed with prefix `photo_[photoId]`
  * Example: `photo_xyz789` for a face detected in photo xyz789

This naming convention allows the system to:
1. Distinguish between reference faces (users) and detected faces (photos)
2. Efficiently search for matches without ambiguity
3. Maintain a clear relationship between faces and their sources

### 2.3 Matching Process Step-by-Step

#### User Registration & Historical Matching:

1. User registers via frontend (`FaceRegistration.js` modal)
2. Face image sent to `shmong-face-register` Lambda
3. Lambda indexes face with `user_[userId]` prefix in Rekognition
4. Lambda stores user's `faceId` in `shmong-face-data` table
5. Lambda **asynchronously triggers** a background task passing `userId` and `faceId`
6. Registration endpoint returns **quickly** to the user
7. **Background Task:**
   * Searches Rekognition (`SearchFaces`) for faces matching the new user's `faceId` (looking for `photo_` prefixes)
   * For each match, updates the corresponding photo's `matched_users` array in `shmong-photos` to include the new `userId`
   * Updates `historicalMatches` in `shmong-face-data` (optional)
   * Sends a notification to the user upon completion (optional)

#### Photo Upload & Future Matching:

1. User uploads photo using the dropzone interface in `PhotoUploader.tsx`
2. Photo stored in S3, metadata stored in `shmong-photos` (with `user_visibility` map initialized with uploader set to `'VISIBLE'`)
3. Rekognition detects faces, indexed with `photo_[photoId]` prefix
4. System performs immediate matching:
   * For each detected face (`photo_` prefix), searches Rekognition for matching `user_` faces
   * Updates the *new photo's* `matched_users` array with the `userId` of each valid match
5. Matched users will see this photo in their "My Photos" view (via `<MyPhotos />` component)

### 2.4 Photo Visibility & Trash System

The system uses a user-specific visibility map stored in DynamoDB to control what each user sees:

```javascript
// Example DynamoDB item in shmong-photos table
{
  "id": "photo-123",
  "user_id": "user-who-uploaded-it",
  "upload_date": "2023-09-15T14:30:00Z",
  "url": "https://s3.bucket.com/photos/photo-123.jpg",
  "faces": [
    { "id": "face-456", "faceId": "AWS-face-id-1", "boundingBox": {...} },
    { "id": "face-789", "faceId": "AWS-face-id-2", "boundingBox": {...} }
  ],
  "matched_users": ["user-1", "user-2"],
  "user_visibility": {
    "user-1": "VISIBLE",  // This user sees the photo normally
    "user-2": "TRASH",    // This user has moved it to trash
    "user-3": "HIDDEN"    // This user has permanently hidden it
  }
}
```

#### Visibility Control Flow:

1. **Viewing Photos:**
   * `MyPhotos.jsx` and `PhotoManager.js` use `awsPhotoService.getVisiblePhotos()`
   * This function filters out photos where `user_visibility[userId] !== 'VISIBLE'`
   * Result: Users only see photos they haven't trashed or hidden

2. **Trashing Photos:**
   * User clicks trash icon on a photo in grid view or full-screen viewer
   * `userVisibilityService.movePhotosToTrash(photoId, userId)` is called
   * This updates the photo's `user_visibility` map: `user_visibility[userId] = 'TRASH'`
   * Photo immediately disappears from normal view

3. **Managing Trash:**
   * User navigates to Trash tab in Dashboard
   * `TrashBin.jsx` loads trashed photos using `awsPhotoService.fetchPhotosByVisibility(userId, 'all', 'TRASH')`
   * User can filter between "Trashed Uploads" and "Trashed Matches"
   * Options to restore (`user_visibility[userId] = 'VISIBLE'`) or permanently hide (`user_visibility[userId] = 'HIDDEN'`)

## 3. Comprehensive View of the Matching Process

### 3.1 Face Registration and Historical Matching

When a user registers their face in the Shmong system, the following process is executed:

1. **Face Capture**: Using the `FaceRegistration.jsx` component, the user's face is captured either via webcam or uploaded image.
2. **Face Detection**: The captured image is first validated using Rekognition's `DetectFacesCommand` to ensure a single valid face is present.
3. **Face Indexing**: The validated face is sent to AWS Rekognition using the `IndexFacesCommand` and added to the collection with the user's ID as the `ExternalImageId`.
4. **FaceId Storage**: The resulting `FaceId` is stored in the user's profile in the `face_data` table.
5. **Historical Matching Trigger**: Once indexed, the system initiates a historical matching process against all existing photos:
   - The user's `FaceId` is used with the `SearchFacesCommand` to find similar faces in the collection
   - This is a comparison of 1 user's face ↔ all existing photo faces
   - Results with similarity scores above the threshold (typically 80) are considered matches
6. **Match Recording**: All historical matches are recorded in the database with:
   - User ID, Face ID
   - Photo ID where the match was found
   - Similarity score 
   - Timestamp of the match

Historical matching is an intensive background process that is typically executed asynchronously to avoid blocking the user interface. In high-volume systems, this is delegated to a Lambda function (`shmong-historical-matcher`) to offload processing from the main application.

### 3.2 Photo Upload and Future Matching

When a user uploads a new photo, the future matching process is executed:

1. **Photo Upload**: The user uploads a photo through the `PhotoUploader` component.
2. **Face Detection**: The system scans the uploaded photo using `DetectFacesCommand` to identify all faces present.
3. **Face Matching**: Each detected face in the photo is searched against the collection using `SearchFacesByImageCommand`.
4. **Match Processing**: For each face in the photo that matches registered users:
   - The match information is stored in the photo's `matched_users` array
   - Each match includes user ID, face ID, similarity score, and timestamp
5. **Visibility Management**: Based on the match information, the visibility system determines who can see the photo:
   - Uploaders always see their own uploads
   - Users with faces in the photo will see it in their "My Photos" view
   - The visibility status is stored in the `photo_visibility` table

Future matching occurs in real-time as part of the photo upload process, allowing immediate feedback to users about who has been identified in their photos.

### 3.3 Bidirectional Matching Synchronization

To ensure consistency in the matching system, a bidirectional synchronization process periodically runs to:

1. Check that all user→photo matches also have corresponding photo→user matches
2. Update any missing matches to maintain data integrity
3. Reconcile any discrepancies in similarity scores or other metadata

This process is implemented in the `updateBidirectionalMatches` function in `faceMatchingService.js` and can be triggered manually via admin controls or automatically by scheduled tasks.

## 4. File Structure and Component Integration

### 4.1 Core Matching System Files

The face matching system spans multiple files with specific responsibilities:

| File | Purpose | Key Functions |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `FaceDetectionService.js` | Low-level face detection and comparison | `detectFaces`, `compareFaces` |
| `face-matching/FaceMatchingService.js` | Core matching logic and AWS integration | `registerUserFace`, `matchFaces` |
| `FaceIndexingService.jsx` | Face registration and indexing | `indexUserFace`, `matchAgainstExistingFaces` |
| `faceMatchingService.js` | High-level matching operations | `updateBidirectionalMatches`, `updateAllUserMatches` |
| `faceMatchingService.ts` | TypeScript implementation (newer components) | `searchFacesByFaceId`, `indexFaceForRegistration` |
| `FaceStorageService.js` | Face data storage and retrieval | `getFaceDataForUser`, `updateFaceData` |

### 4.2 User Interface Integration Components

| Component | Purpose | Integration Points |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| `FaceRegistration.jsx` | User face registration UI | Captures face image and initiates registration through `FaceIndexingService` |
| `FaceRegistrationNew.jsx` | Updated face registration component | Uses newer API methods through `face-matching/api` |
| `PhotoUploader.tsx` | Photo upload interface | Initiates face detection and matching through `FaceDetectionService` |
| `MyPhotos.jsx` | Displays matched photos for a user | Consumes match data from DynamoDB tables |
| `TrashBin.jsx` | Manages photos moved to trash | Interacts with visibility system for photo recovery |

### 4.3 Uploader and Face Registration Interaction

The interaction between the photo uploader and face registration components is critical to the matching system:

1. **Face Registration First Approach**: The system is designed with a "register first" philosophy:
   - Users register their face during onboarding before interacting with photos
   - This enables immediate matching when photos are later uploaded
   - Users are prompted to register before attempting to claim matches

2. **Integration Flow**:
   - `FaceRegistration.jsx` → Captures face → `FaceIndexingService.jsx` → Indexes face in AWS
   - `PhotoUploader.tsx` → Uploads photo → `FaceDetectionService.js` → Detects faces
   - `FaceMatchingService.js` → Matches faces → Updates DynamoDB → `userVisibilityService.js` → Sets visibility

3. **Data Exchange**:
   - Registration provides `FaceId` values stored in user profiles
   - Uploads use these `FaceId` values to establish match relationships
   - Match information flows bidirectionally between users and photos

Each component maintains strict separation of concerns while sharing the standardized data formats needed for the matching system to operate effectively.

### 4.4 DynamoDB Tables Structure for Matching

The matching system relies on several key DynamoDB tables:

| Table | Purpose | Key Fields |
|-------|---------|------------|
| `shmong-face-data` | Stores registered user faces | `user_id`, `face_id`, `created_at` |
| `shmong-photos` | Stores uploaded photos | `id`, `url`, `faces`, `matched_users`, `uploaded_by` |
| `shmong-photo-visibility` | Controls photo visibility | `photo_id`, `user_id`, `status`, `updated_at` |
| `shmong-user-matches` | Aggregate match information | `user_id`, `matched_photo_ids`, `updated_at` |

This table structure allows efficient querying of matches from both the user and photo perspectives, supporting both the UI display requirements and matching system operations.

## 5. UI Components and User Experience

### 5.1 Dashboard and Navigation

The Dashboard provides a tabbed interface for navigating the application:

1. **Home Tab**: Displays user information and face registration status
2. **Matches Tab**: Shows photos where the user has been recognized
3. **Upload Tab**: Provides interface for uploading and managing photos
4. **Trash Tab**: Allows users to view and manage trashed photos

The Dashboard is implemented in `Dashboard.jsx` and serves as the central navigation hub for the application.

### 5.2 Enhanced PhotoGrid Component

const TrashBin = () => {
  const [activeView, setActiveView] = useState('uploaded');
  const [photos, setPhotos] = useState([]);
  const [selectedPhotos, setSelectedPhotos] = useState([]);
  
  // Fetch trashed photos based on activeView
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchTrashedPhotos();
  }, [activeView]);
  
  return (
    <div>
      {/* View toggle */}
      <div className="flex space-x-2 mb-4">
        <button onClick={() => setActiveView('uploaded')}>
          Trashed Uploads

2. **Touch Controls**: Supports pinch-to-zoom and swipe gestures
3. **Adaptive Layouts**: Stacks controls vertically on smaller screens
4. **Native Interactions**: Uses device capabilities when available

## 6. Technical Implementation Details

### 6.1 Photo Visibility System (DynamoDB)

Photos in the system have a user-specific visibility status stored in a map:

```javascript
// Example DynamoDB structure in shmong-photos table
{
  "id": "photo-123",
  "user_id": "uploader-id",
  "url": "https://s3.bucket/photos/photo-123.jpg",
  "faces": [...],
  "matched_users": ["user-1", "user-2"],
  "user_visibility": {
    "user-1": "VISIBLE",   // This user sees the photo
    "user-2": "TRASH",     // This user moved it to trash
    "user-3": "HIDDEN"     // This user permanently hid it
  }
}
```

This design allows each user to have a personalized view of the photo collection without affecting other users.

### 6.2 Vite Project File Extensions

Vite requires specific file extensions for proper syntax parsing:

- `.jsx` extension for files containing React JSX syntax
- `.tsx` extension for TypeScript files with JSX syntax
- `.js` extension for regular JavaScript files without JSX

Using incorrect extensions (like `.js` for files containing JSX) will cause parsing errors during development and build. Always verify file extensions match their content type.

### 6.3 Trash System Implementation

The trash system architecture relies on the user_visibility map:

1. **Moving to Trash**: `user_visibility[userId] = "TRASH"`
2. **Restoring**: `user_visibility[userId] = "VISIBLE"`
3. **Permanently Hiding**: `user_visibility[userId] = "HIDDEN"`
4. **Viewing Photos**: Only show photos where `user_visibility[userId] === "VISIBLE"`
5. **Viewing Trash**: Show photos where `user_visibility[userId] === "TRASH"`

Key service functions:

```javascript
// userVisibilityService.js
export const movePhotosToTrash = async (photoIds, userId) => {
  // Update DynamoDB items to set user_visibility[userId] = "TRASH"
};

export const restorePhotosFromTrash = async (photoIds, userId) => {
  // Update DynamoDB items to set user_visibility[userId] = "VISIBLE"
};

export const permanentlyHidePhotos = async (photoIds, userId) => {
  // Update DynamoDB items to set user_visibility[userId] = "HIDDEN"
};
```

### 6.4 Image Viewer Implementation

The image viewer uses several technologies for a smooth experience:

1. **Framer Motion**: For animations and transitions
2. **FileReader API**: For generating image previews
3. **Web Share API**: For native sharing on supported devices
4. **Fullscreen API**: For toggle fullscreen viewing

Key features:

```jsx
// In PhotoUploader.tsx
// Generate preview URLs for images
const generatePreviewUrl = useCallback((file: File): Promise<string> => {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    const reader = new FileReader();
    reader.onload = () => {
      resolve(reader.result as string);
    };
    reader.readAsDataURL(file);
  });
}, []);

// Handle image download
const handleDownload = async (upload: UploadItem) => {
  const url = upload.s3Url || upload.previewUrl;
  const a = document.createElement('a');
  a.href = url;
  a.download = upload.file.name;
  document.body.appendChild(a);
  a.click();
  document.body.removeChild(a);
};

// Toggle fullscreen
const toggleFullscreen = () => {
  if (!document.fullscreenElement) {
    document.documentElement.requestFullscreen();
  } else {
    document.exitFullscreen();
  }
};

// Native sharing (with fallback)
const handleShare = () => {
  if (navigator.share) {
    navigator.share({
      title: viewerImage.file.name,
      url: viewerImage.s3Url
    }).catch(() => {
      // Fallback to download if sharing fails
      handleDownload(viewerImage);
    });
  } else {
    // Fallback for browsers without Web Share API
    handleDownload(viewerImage);
  }
};
```

## 10. DynamoDB Implementation Considerations

### 10.1 Pagination Requirements for Photo Retrieval

When retrieving photos from DynamoDB, especially with face matching queries, it's critical to implement proper pagination to ensure all results are returned. DynamoDB has an inherent 1MB result size limit per query/scan operation, which means:

1. **Large Data Sets Will Be Truncated**: Without pagination, DynamoDB returns only the first 1MB batch of results (typically 10-20 photos depending on metadata size)
2. **LastEvaluatedKey Is Required**: To retrieve all results, you must use the `LastEvaluatedKey` value returned from each response to continue fetching subsequent batches

```javascript
// CORRECT implementation with pagination
async function fetchAllPhotos() {
  let allPhotos = [];
  let lastEvaluatedKey;
  
  do {
    const params = {
      TableName: PHOTOS_TABLE,
      ExclusiveStartKey: lastEvaluatedKey // Used for pagination
    };
    
    const response = await docClient.send(new ScanCommand(params));
    
    // Add results to our collection
    allPhotos = [...allPhotos, ...(response.Items || [])];
    
    // Get the key for the next page of results
    lastEvaluatedKey = response.LastEvaluatedKey;
    
  } while (lastEvaluatedKey); // Continue until no more results
  
  return allPhotos;
}

// INCORRECT implementation (only retrieves first batch)
async function fetchPhotosIncorrect() {
  const params = {
    TableName: PHOTOS_TABLE
  };
  
  const response = await docClient.send(new ScanCommand(params));
  return response.Items || [];
}
```

### 10.2 Impact on User Experience

Failure to implement proper pagination can lead to serious user experience issues:

1. **Incomplete Photo Sets**: Users only see a subset of their photos (usually 10-20 items)
2. **Inconsistent Matching Results**: Different users may see different subsets of matches
3. **Random-Appearing Behavior**: Photos may appear to randomly "disappear" when other photos are added and push them out of the first batch

### 10.3 Client-Side Filtering Considerations

When implementing client-side filtering (such as the visibility filtering):

1. **Filter After Full Retrieval**: Always fetch all photos first using proper pagination, then apply client-side filters
2. **Use Appropriate DynamoDB Query Methods**: When available, use Query instead of Scan for better performance
3. **Consider Data Size**: For extremely large collections, consider implementing server-side filtering using DynamoDB's FilterExpression

### 10.4 Best Practices

1. **Always Implement Pagination**: For any Scan or Query operation on DynamoDB
2. **Log Result Counts**: Add logging to verify expected total counts versus actual counts
3. **Implement Monitoring**: Add monitoring to detect when result counts drop unexpectedly
4. **Use Performance Tests**: Test with large data sets to ensure pagination works correctly
5. **Consider Query over Scan**: Use Query with indexes whenever possible for better performance
