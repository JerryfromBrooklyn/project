1.6. **Uploader Responsibility.** If you upload content containing other individuals, you are solely and exclusively responsible for obtaining their written consent, notifying them of this policy, and documenting their acceptance as specified in the Terms of Service. SHMONG's role is limited to requiring uploaders to certify they have obtained proper consent before uploading biometric data.

   - You maintain verifiable records of these consents
   - You take full legal responsibility for the consent collection process

This checkbox is non-optional, and uploads cannot proceed without this certification. SHMONG maintains records of these certifications, including timestamps and user information. However, SHMONG does not independently verify the actual consent documents and relies entirely on uploader certifications.

1.9. **SHMONG's Limited Role in Consent Process.** SHMONG's role regarding consent is limited to:
   - Requiring uploaders to certify they have obtained proper consent
   - Providing uploaders with information about consent requirements

   - Maintaining records of uploader certifications
   SHMONG does not verify the actual consent documents obtained by uploaders and relies entirely on uploader certifications regarding consent.

> - You must check a box confirming you have their permission
> - You are responsible for actually getting their written permission
> - We keep a record of your certification but don't check the actual permission forms
> - We trust that when you check the box, you've truly gotten proper permission

   - Removal of all Content uploaded without proper consent documentation
   - Prohibition from creating new accounts on the platform
