## EXPLANATION OF KEY TERMS

**Multiple Touchpoint Consent Model**: This refers to the approach that uploaders must implement for collecting explicit consent at various points throughout an individual's interaction with the service, rather than just once. Uploaders must implement this through:
1. Initial account creation consent checkbox
2. Additional consent prompt before first use of virtual try-on features
3. Periodic consent renewal prompts (annually)
4. Separate consent for each new biometric feature introduced
5. Clear opt-out options at each touchpoint

This multi-layered approach ensures that consent is specific, informed, and continuously validated, which strengthens legal compliance and privacy rights.

**Uploader Certification Implementation**: Uploaders are solely responsible for obtaining consent from individuals in uploaded photos. To address this responsibility:
1. Uploaders must require individuals to check a certification box with each consent
2. Uploaders must maintain timestamped logs of these certifications
3. Uploaders must provide educational materials about consent requirements
4. Uploaders must implement a robust notice-and-takedown process for individuals who believe their image was uploaded without consent
5. Uploaders must respond promptly to takedown requests
6. Uploaders acknowledge that the Company reserves the right to suspend accounts with repeated violations

While the Company cannot verify the existence of written consent obtained by uploaders, these measures demonstrate the uploaders' good faith effort to promote compliance with biometric privacy laws.

**Unambiguous Consent Collection**: This refers to obtaining clear, affirmative consent that leaves no doubt about the user's intentions. Uploaders must implement this through:
1. Opt-in (rather than opt-out) consent mechanisms
2. Consent checkboxes that are never pre-checked
3. Clear, specific language describing what the user is consenting to
4. Separate consent for biometric data collection distinct from general terms
5. Visual design that draws attention to consent requests (contrasting colors, bold text)
6. Requiring explicit action (clicking "I agree" rather than passive browsing)
7. Maintaining consent records including timestamp and version of terms agreed to
