# 🔍 Face Matching System Testing Guide

This document outlines steps to verify that the face matching system is working correctly.

## 🧪 Prerequisites

1. The SQL functions have been deployed to your Supabase instance
2. The updated FaceIndexingService.js code is in place
3. You have a user account created with a face registered

## 🔧 Setup

### 1. Copy the Debugging Tools to Your Browser Console

Copy the entire content of `debug-photo-matching.js` into your browser console and press Enter. This will load all the debugging tools you need to troubleshoot face matching issues.

You should see a confirmation message with available commands.

### 2. Verify Database Functions

Run this in your browser console to check if the SQL functions are installed:

```javascript
// Test if the functions exist
const testFunctions = async () => {
  const { data, error } = await window.supabase.rpc('function_exists', { function_name: 'admin_update_photo_matches' });
  console.log(`Admin functions exist: ${data === true ? "✅ YES" : "❌ NO"}`);
  if (error) console.error("Error checking functions:", error);
};
testFunctions();
```

If the functions don't exist, run the SQL script from `admin_sql_function.sql` in your Supabase dashboard.

## 📋 Testing Steps

### 1. Check Your User Information

First, check if your face is registered correctly:

```javascript
// Get your user info
photoMatchingDebug.findMyPhotos();
```

This will show:
- Your user ID
- Any photos that match your face
- Database schema information
- Sample photo data structure

### 2. Test Face Registration

1. Go to the Face Registration page
2. Position your face in the camera view
3. Complete the registration process
4. Check the browser console for logs starting with `[FACE-SVC]`
5. Verify you see a success message with your face ID

### 3. Test Direct Photo Matching

1. Upload a new photo containing your face
2. Wait for processing to complete
3. Check console logs for:
   ```
   [FACE-MATCH] 🔄 Adding User Match to Photo
   [FACE-MATCH] ✅ ADMIN FUNCTION SUCCEEDED
   [FACE-MATCH] ✅ VERIFICATION PASSED: User ID found in matched_users array!
   ```

4. Verify the photo appears in your "My Photos" tab

### 4. Test Historical Matching

1. Wait for background processing to complete (1-2 minutes)
2. Check console logs for:
   ```
   [BACKGROUND] 🔍 Processing Historical Matching
   [BACKGROUND] 📊 Completed updates: X successful, 0 failed
   ```

3. Refresh your "My Photos" tab to see any newly matched photos

## 🚨 Emergency Repair (If Matches Still Don't Show)

If the photos are matched by AWS but still don't show in your "My Photos" tab, try the emergency repair:

```javascript
// Emergency repair of all your face matches
photoMatchingDebug.emergencyRepair();
```

This will:
1. Find all photos containing your face in the `unassociated_faces` table
2. Force-update each photo with your user ID
3. Show detailed logs of the repair process

## 🔧 Debugging Individual Photos

If you want to check or fix specific photos:

```javascript
// Check a specific photo
photoMatchingDebug.checkPhoto('your-photo-id-here');

// Force match a specific photo to your user
photoMatchingDebug.forceMatchUser('your-photo-id-here', 'your-user-id-here');
```

## 📋 Log Analysis

When reviewing logs, look for these emoji indicators to understand what's happening:

| Emoji | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 🔄 | Process in progress |
| 📋 | Data display |
| 📊 | Statistics |
| ✅ | Success |
| ⚠️ | Warning |
| ❌ | Error |
| 🔍 | Searching/Checking |
| 🛠️ | Repair operation |
| 🚨 | Emergency action |

## 🧩 Common Issues and Solutions

1. **"Invalid UUID format" errors**
   - The photo ID may not be a valid UUID format
   - Solution: Use the emergency repair to forcibly update the photos

2. **"No rows returned" verification errors**
   - The database query can't find the photo after updating it
   - Solution: Use the `debug_check_photo` function to verify the photo exists

3. **"matched_users is not an array" errors**
   - The matched_users field has an incorrect format
   - Solution: Use `debug_force_update_photo` to reset the field to a proper array

4. **Database permission errors**
   - RLS policies may be preventing updates
   - Solution: Ensure the admin functions are installed and have SECURITY DEFINER

## 📊 Expected Results

After completing these tests, you should see:

1. Successful face registration (with a face ID stored)
2. New photos with your face automatically matched
3. Photos in your "My Photos" tab
4. Console logs showing successful database updates
5. Database verification script confirming matches in the database
