## üìú Instructions for AI/LLM Updating This Document

1.  **Scan First:** Before answering queries or making changes, **always review this document** to understand the current state, structure, and interactions of the face recognition components.
2.  **Inspect Database (Pre-Change):** Before planning or implementing database-related code changes or direct database modifications:
    *   Use the AWS CLI (e.g., `aws dynamodb describe-table --table-name shmong-face-data`, `aws dynamodb scan --table-name shmong-face-data --limit 10`) to inspect the current **schema**, **naming conventions**, and **sample data** in relevant DynamoDB tables (primarily `shmong-face-data`).
    *   Verify consistency between the code's assumptions and the actual database state.
    *   **(If AWS MCP tools are activated and relevant for structured data analysis, consider using them for deeper insights into database structure and relationships.)**
    *   **CLI Pagination:** Ensure all AWS CLI commands that might produce long output include the `--no-paginate` flag (or equivalent configuration) to **prevent interactive prompts like `-- More --`** and ensure the full output is returned directly.
3.  **Update Automatically:** When significant changes are made to the files, data structures, AWS services used, or processes listed herein (especially related to face indexing, storage, matching, or deployment), **you MUST automatically update this document accordingly within the same turn the change is made**.
    *   Update the `Last Updated` timestamp.
    *   Modify relevant sections (file descriptions, interactions, data structures, deployment steps, AWS services, workflow).
    *   Add new files or components if introduced.
    *   Remove obsolete information.
4.  **Verify Changes:** When you update code mentioned here, ensure the descriptions and interactions in this document still accurately reflect the new code logic.
5.  **Reference Actively:** Use the information here to inform your responses and code generation. Refer back to it if unsure about how components interact or where specific logic resides.
6.  **Goal:** This document serves as the "single source of truth" for the AI regarding the face recognition system's architecture and operation within this project.

## üîÑ Standard Development Workflow

This workflow should be followed for implementing features or fixing issues:

1.  **Understand Request:** Receive the user's problem description or feature request.
2.  **Contextualize (MATRIX):** Scan `THE_MATRIX.md` (this document) to understand relevant file locations, component interactions, data structures, and AWS services.
3.  **Verify State (Database):** If the request involves database interaction, use AWS CLI (`--no-paginate`) to inspect the current state (schema, naming, sample data) of the relevant DynamoDB tables (esp. `shmong-face-data`). Confirm alignment with the MATRIX documentation and the user's request.
4.  **Plan & Propose:**
    *   Develop at least three distinct, viable plans to address the request.
    *   Prioritize scalability, maintainability, and safety (avoiding breaking changes).
    *   For each plan, clearly outline:
        *   Pros and Cons.
        *   Specific file(s) to be modified.
        *   Database tables/schemas/attributes affected (if any).
        *   How the changes address the user's request.
    *   Present the graded plans to the user for review.
5.  **User Approval:** Wait for the user to select and approve one of the proposed plans.
6.  **Implement Changes:** Carefully implement the approved plan, making the necessary code edits.
7.  **Build & Deploy:**
    *   Use the established build and deployment script: `npm run deploy-auto`.
    *   This script handles version incrementing, building, uploading to S3, and CloudFront invalidation.
    *   Monitor the script output for success.
8.  **Update MATRIX:** Automatically update `THE_MATRIX.md` in the same turn to reflect the changes made (update timestamp, modified file descriptions, interactions, etc.).
9.  **Confirm:** Inform the user that the changes have been implemented, deployed, and the documentation updated.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration & Credentials

*   **Source File:** Credentials and configuration constants are primarily managed in the `.env` file located in the project root.
*   **Loading:** The Vite build process makes environment variables starting with `VITE_` accessible in the frontend application code via `import.meta.env.VARIABLE_NAME`.
*   **Security:** The `.env` file contains sensitive information and **MUST NOT** be committed to version control (it should be listed in `.gitignore`). In production environments, these values should be injected securely (e.g., via CI/CD pipeline environment variables, secrets management services).

*   **Key Variables (.env):**
    *   `VITE_AWS_REGION`: The AWS region for services (e.g., `us-east-1`).
    *   `VITE_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: The AWS Access Key ID used for authenticating SDK calls.
    *   `VITE_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: The AWS Secret Access Key used for authenticating SDK calls.
    *   `VITE_AWS_COLLECTION_ID`: The name of the AWS Rekognition collection used to store indexed faces (e.g., `shmong-faces`).
    *   *(Other variables for Supabase, Cognito, etc. are also present)*.

*   **Usage in Code (`src/config/aws-config.js`):**
    *   The AWS configuration file (`src/config/aws-config.js`) reads these `import.meta.env` variables to initialize and configure the AWS SDK v3 clients (Rekognition, DynamoDB, S3).

---

## üöÄ Build & Deployment Process

The application uses Vite for building and custom scripts for deployment to AWS S3 and CloudFront.

**1. Build:**
   *   Command: `npm run build`
   *   Purpose: This command compiles the React application using Vite, bundles assets (JS, CSS), handles TypeScript compilation, and prepares the `dist/` directory for deployment. It also automatically runs `npm run increment-build` beforehand to update the build version number in `src/version.js`.

**2. Deploy:**
   *   Command: `npm run deploy-auto`
   *   Purpose: This command triggers the automated deployment script (`scripts/deploy-auto.js`), which in turn calls the platform-specific script (`deploy.ps1` for Windows).
   *   **Actions Performed by Script:**
        *   Runs `npm run build` again (including version increment).
        *   Uses AWS CLI (`aws s3 sync` or `aws s3 cp`) to upload the contents of the `dist/` directory to the `s3://shmong/` bucket (specifically the `assets/` path for JS/CSS). It usually deletes old asset files.
        *   Uses AWS CLI (`aws cloudfront create-invalidation`) to invalidate the CloudFront cache (`/*`) for distribution `E3OEKXFISG92UV`, ensuring users get the latest version.
        *   **AWS CLI Pager:** The environment or scripts are configured such that AWS CLI commands automatically use `--no-paginate` or equivalent, **explicitly preventing the interactive `--more--` prompt** and facilitating automated processing.

**Verification:**
   *   Check the output of the `deploy-auto` script for success messages and the CloudFront invalidation ID.
   *   Access the application via the CloudFront URL: `https://d3hl8q20rgtlyy.cloudfront.net` (cache invalidation might take a few minutes).

## ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS Services Used

This section details the AWS services utilized by the application and their roles.

**1. AWS Rekognition**

   *   **Purpose:** Provides AI-powered image analysis capabilities, specifically for detecting, indexing, and searching faces.
   *   **Why Used:** Leveraged for its robust and scalable face detection, attribute analysis (age, gender, emotion), face storage (in a collection), and face comparison/matching features, forming the core of the face recognition functionality.
   *   **How Used / Key APIs:**
        *   `IndexFaces`: Detects faces in an image, extracts attributes, assigns a unique `FaceId`, adds the face to a specified collection (`shmong-faces`), and associates it with an `ExternalImageId` (our `userId`). Used during user face registration.
        *   `SearchFacesByImage`: Searches for faces in the collection that match faces detected in a provided image.
        *   `SearchFaces`: Searches for faces in the collection that match a provided `FaceId`.
   *   **Interactions:**
        *   Called by: `FaceIndexingService.js` (functions `indexFace`, `matchFace`, `searchFaceByImage`).
        *   Provides data for: Storage in DynamoDB (`shmong-face-data` table via `storeFaceData` function).
        *   Triggered by: User actions like registering a face or potentially searching for matches.

**2. AWS DynamoDB**

   *   **Purpose:** A fully managed NoSQL key-value and document database.
   *   **Why Used:** Provides a scalable, fast, and flexible way to store the mapping between application users (`userId`) and their corresponding Rekognition `FaceId`s, along with the extracted face attributes and other metadata. Its key-value nature is well-suited for retrieving face data based on the user ID.
   *   **How Used / Key APIs:**
        *   `PutItem`: Creates or replaces an entire item in the `shmong-face-data` table. Used by `storeFaceData` to save face registration details.
        *   `GetItem` / `Query`: Used to retrieve face data for a user (e.g., by `userId`) for display on the dashboard.
        *   *(Other operations like `UpdateItem` might be used by utility/debug functions)*.
   *   **Interactions:**
        *   Called by: `FaceStorageService.js` (or equivalent functions within `FaceIndexingService.js` or `EmergencyTools.js`), potentially `Dashboard.js` or its data fetching logic.
        *   Receives data from: `FaceIndexingService.js` (after processing Rekognition results).
        *   Provides data to: `Dashboard.js` for displaying user face information and attributes.

**3. AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service)**

   *   **Purpose:** Object storage service.
   *   **Why Used:** Used for two primary purposes:
        1.  **Hosting Static Website Assets:** Stores the built React application files (HTML, JS, CSS, images) generated by `npm run build`.
        2.  **(Optional/Potential) Storing Original Images:** Could be used to store the original images uploaded by users during registration (referenced by `public_url` in DynamoDB), although current implementation focuses on Rekognition indexing.
   *   **How Used / Key APIs:**
        *   `aws s3 sync` / `aws s3 cp` (via AWS CLI in deployment scripts): Uploads built application assets from the local `dist/` folder to the `s3://shmong/` bucket.
        *   `PutObject` (via SDK): Would be used if storing original user images.
   *   **Interactions:**
        *   Deployment scripts (`deploy.ps1`, `deploy-auto.js`) write build artifacts to S3.
        *   CloudFront reads static assets from the S3 bucket to serve the website.
        *   (If image storage implemented): `FaceStorageService.js` might write original images to S3.

**4. AWS CloudFront**

   *   **Purpose:** Content Delivery Network (CDN) service.
   *   **Why Used:** Distributes the web application globally, caches static assets (from S3) closer to users for faster loading times, provides HTTPS termination, and potentially routes API requests.
   *   **How Used / Key APIs:**
        *   Distribution `E3OEKXFISG92UV`: Configured to serve content primarily from the S3 bucket (`s3://shmong/`).
        *   Cache Invalidation (`aws cloudfront create-invalidation` via AWS CLI): Used in deployment scripts to purge cached content after updates, ensuring users receive the latest application version.
        *   **(Potential) Behavior for API Routing:** Can be configured with behaviors to route specific path patterns (e.g., `/api/*`) to backend services like API Gateway or Lambda, although current interactions seem client-side SDK based.
   *   **Interactions:**
        *   Retrieves static assets (HTML, JS, CSS) from the S3 bucket (`s3://shmong/`).
        *   Serves content to end-users' browsers via `https://d3hl8q20rgtlyy.cloudfront.net`.
        *   Deployment scripts interact with it via the AWS CLI to perform cache invalidations.

**(5. AWS Lambda - Potential/Implied)**

   *   **Purpose:** Serverless compute service.
   *   **Why Used (if applicable):** Often used as a backend API endpoint (triggered via API Gateway or directly via Function URL) to handle requests that shouldn't expose AWS credentials directly in the browser (e.g., performing database writes/reads, calling other AWS services). Debug tools previously mentioned a Lambda URL (`https://g5lcn763ibjq4wqsn3lvrswb6y0jztnz.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws`), suggesting it might exist for certain operations, even if the primary flow now uses client-side SDK calls.
   *   **How Used / Key APIs:** If used, it would likely contain Node.js code using the AWS SDK to interact with DynamoDB, Rekognition, etc.
   *   **Interactions:** Would be called via HTTPS requests (e.g., `fetch`) from the frontend application (`Dashboard.js`, `EmergencyTools.js`) and would, in turn, interact with other AWS services like DynamoDB.

## üíæ Core Data Structures & Concepts

**1. AWS Rekognition `IndexFaces` API Response Structure (Key Parts)**

   *   **Top-Level Response:** `Object`
        *   `FaceRecords`: `Array of Objects`. Each object represents one indexed face.
            *   **Object in `FaceRecords`**:
                *   `Face`: `Object`. Basic identification.
                    *   `FaceId`: `String` (Unique ID assigned by Rekognition).
                    *   `BoundingBox`: `Object` (Location/size of the face).
                    *   `ImageId`: `String` (ID of the image processed).
                    *   `ExternalImageId`: `String` (ID provided by us, used as `userId`).
                    *   `Confidence`: `Number` (Confidence in face detection).
                *   `FaceDetail`: `Object`. Rich attributes (if requested).
                    *   `AgeRange`: `Object` (`{ Low: Number, High: Number }`).
                    *   `Beard`: `Object` (`{ Value: Boolean, Confidence: Number }`).
                    *   `Emotions`: `Array of Objects` (`[ { Type: String, Confidence: Number }, ... ]`).
                    *   `Gender`: `Object` (`{ Value: String, Confidence: Number }`).
                    *   `Smile`: `Object` (`{ Value: Boolean, Confidence: Number }`).
                    *   *(Other attributes like `Quality`, `Pose`, `Landmarks` may also be present)*.
        *   `UnindexedFaces`: `Array of Objects`. Faces detected but not indexed (e.g., low quality).
        *   `OrientationCorrection`: `String`.
        *   `$metadata`/`ResponseMetadata`: `Object`. API call metadata.

**2. DynamoDB Table: `shmong-face-data`**

   *   **Purpose:** Stores the mapping between users (`userId`) and their indexed Rekognition `FaceId`s, along with associated metadata and face attributes. Serves as the primary data source for user face information displayed on the dashboard.
   *   **Schema Type:** NoSQL Key-Value / Document Store. Items are retrieved based on the primary key.
   *   **Primary Key:**
        *   `userId`: `String` (Partition Key - Corresponds to `ExternalImageId`). Uniquely identifies a user's records.
        *   `faceId`: `String` (Sort Key - The `FaceId` from Rekognition). Allows multiple face records per user (though currently indexing one) and efficient querying/sorting by face ID within a user.
   *   **Key Attributes (Columns/Fields):**
        *   `face_attributes`: `String` (Stores the JSON stringified `FaceDetail` object from Rekognition. Must be parsed on read).
        *   `created_at`: `String` (ISO 8601 timestamp of record creation).
        *   `updated_at`: `String` (ISO 8601 timestamp of last update).
        *   `status`: `String` (Indicates the status of the face record, e.g., "active").
        *   `public_url`: `String` (Optional: S3 URL of the original uploaded image).

## üß© Feature Areas & File Interactions

**Area 1: Face Indexing & Registration**

*   **Purpose:** Handles capturing/uploading user images, sending them to AWS Rekognition for indexing, and storing the results.
*   **Primary Files:**
    *   `src/components/FaceRegistrationModal.jsx`: UI component for capturing webcam images or handling uploads. Triggers the indexing process.
    *   `src/services/FaceIndexingService.jsx`: Contains the `indexUserFace` function that interacts with AWS Rekognition (`IndexFacesCommand`) and extracts attributes from the response. Calls `storeFaceId` in `FaceStorageService.js` to store the data.
    *   `src/services/FaceStorageService.js`: Contains the `storeFaceId` function that first uploads the user's face image to S3 (generating a public URL) and then stores the face ID, attributes (as a JSON string), and public URL in DynamoDB.
    *   `src/config/aws-config.js`: Provides AWS SDK v3 clients (Rekognition, DynamoDB, S3) and configuration constants (Region, Collection ID, Table Name).
*   **Interactions:**
    *   `FaceRegistrationModal.jsx` captures image data (Blob/Buffer).
    *   `FaceRegistrationModal.jsx` calls `indexUserFace` in `FaceIndexingService.jsx`, passing the image data and `userId`.
    *   `FaceIndexingService.jsx` (`indexUserFace`) uses the Rekognition client to call the `IndexFacesCommand`.
    *   `FaceIndexingService.jsx` (`indexUserFace`) extracts `FaceId` and `FaceDetail` from the Rekognition response.
    *   `FaceIndexingService.jsx` (`indexUserFace`) calls `storeFaceId` in `FaceStorageService.js`, passing `userId`, `faceId`, face attributes, and the image data.
    *   `FaceStorageService.js` (`storeFaceId`) uploads the image to S3 and gets the `publicUrl`.
    *   `FaceStorageService.js` (`storeFaceId`) then writes all the data (including `face_attributes` and `public_url`) to the `shmong-face-data` table using `PutItemCommand`.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   Reads: Image Blob/Buffer.
    *   Uses: Rekognition `IndexFacesCommand` response (`FaceRecords`, `Face`, `FaceDetail`).
    *   Writes: Item to DynamoDB `shmong-face-data` table with fields including `userId`, `faceId`, `status`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `face_attributes` (JSON string), and `public_url`.
*   **Debugging Features:**
    *   Utilizes collapsible console groups with emoji categorization for better visibility of large data objects
    *   Provides organized logging of face detection, attribute extraction, and storage processes
    *   Uses distinct emojis to categorize different types of operations (üîç search, üíæ storage, ‚úÖ success, ‚ùå error)

**Area 2: Face Data Display (Dashboard)**

*   **Purpose:** Fetches registered face data (including attributes) for the logged-in user and displays it.
*   **Primary Files:**
    *   `src/pages/Dashboard.js` (or `src/components/Dashboard.jsx` / `src/components/UserDashboard.jsx` - *Need to confirm exact file*): Main component orchestrating data fetching and display.
    *   `src/components/AttributeDisplay.jsx` (If exists, or logic within Dashboard): Component responsible for parsing and rendering the `face_attributes`.
    *   `src/services/database-utils.js`: Contains the `getFaceData` function that queries DynamoDB for the user's face data, including both `face_attributes` and `public_url`.
*   **Interactions:**
    *   `Dashboard.js` fetches data for the current user using `getFaceData` from `database-utils.js`.
    *   `getFaceData` queries the DynamoDB `shmong-face-data` table using various strategies (GSI, fallback query, API Gateway).
    *   `Dashboard.js` receives the DynamoDB item(s) containing both face attributes and the image URL.
    *   `Dashboard.js` parses the `face_attributes` JSON string into a JavaScript object.
    *   `Dashboard.js` renders the face image using the `public_url` and displays the attributes (Age, Gender, Emotions, etc.).
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   Reads: Item(s) from DynamoDB `shmong-face-data` table including `face_attributes` and `public_url`.
    *   Uses: `face_attributes` (JSON string), parsed into a `FaceDetail`-like JavaScript object.
    *   Uses: `public_url` for displaying the user's face image in the UI.
*   **Debugging Features:**
    *   Implements collapsible console groups (üìä) for large objects like raw face data and extraction results
    *   Uses emojis to categorize console messages (‚úÖ success, üß© extraction, üé≠ rendering)
    *   Keeps console output clean while maintaining detailed debugging information

**Area 3: Face Matching (Conceptual)**

*   **Purpose:** Compares a given face (either newly indexed or from an image search) against the existing faces in the Rekognition collection. *(Implementation details might vary)*.
*   **Primary Files:**
    *   `src/services/FaceIndexingService.js`: Likely contains functions like `matchFace` (using `SearchFacesByImage` or `SearchFaces` Rekognition commands).
*   **Interactions:**
    *   A component (e.g., `Dashboard.js` or a dedicated search component) might trigger `matchFace` or `searchFaceByImage`.
    *   `FaceIndexingService.js` uses the Rekognition client (from `aws-config.js`) to call `SearchFaces` or `SearchFacesByImage`.
    *   The function receives a list of matching faces (`FaceMatches`) from Rekognition, each containing `Similarity` and `Face` (with `ExternalImageId`/`userId`).
    *   The results are returned to the calling component for display.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   Uses: Rekognition `SearchFaces` / `SearchFacesByImage` response (`FaceMatches` array).
    *   Reads (Indirectly): Rekognition Collection (`shmong-faces`).

**Area 4: Utilities & Debugging**

*   **Purpose:** Provides configuration and helper functions, including debugging tools.
*   **Primary Files:**
    *   `src/config/aws-config.js`: Centralized AWS SDK client initialization and constants.
    *   `src/utils/EmergencyTools.js`: Contains functions for manual data inspection or repair (like the `fixFaceAttributes` function previously used).
    *   `src/pages/Dashboard.js`, `src/services/FaceIndexingService.jsx`, `src/services/FaceStorageService.js`: Contain enhanced logging with collapsible groups for better debugging.
*   **Interactions:**
    *   `aws-config.js` is imported by service files (`FaceIndexingService.js`, potentially `Dashboard.js`) needing AWS clients.
    *   `EmergencyTools.js` might be invoked manually via the browser console for debugging; interacts directly with AWS services (DynamoDB, potentially Lambda) via `aws-config.js`.
    *   Console logs throughout the system use collapsible groups and emojis to organize debugging information.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   Reads/Writes: Directly interacts with DynamoDB `shmong-face-data` table or other AWS resources depending on the tool.
*   **Console Debugging Enhancements:**
    *   **Collapsible Groups:** Large data objects (face attributes, raw responses) use `console.groupCollapsed()` to avoid cluttering the console
    *   **Emoji Categorization:** Consistent emoji system across all service files:
        *   üîç Search/lookup operations
        *   üíæ Storage operations
        *   üîÑ Conversion/transformation
        *   üìä Data/attributes
        *   üì∑ Image related
        *   ‚úÖ Success indicators
        *   ‚ùå Error indicators
        *   üìã General information
        *   üöÄ API/service calls
    *   **Context-Specific Groups:** Different processes have specialized logging categories with grouped output
    *   **Standardized Format:** All console logs follow consistent module-prefixed format like `üìä [Dashboard] Raw face data:`

**Area 5: Performance Optimizations & Browser Compatibility**

*   **Purpose:** Provides optimizations for handling large datasets and ensures browser compatibility for Node.js-specific functionality.
*   **Primary Files:**
    *   `src/services/FaceStorageService.js`: Implements browser-compatible image data handling to resolve "Buffer is not defined" errors during face registration.
    *   `src/components/VirtualizedList.jsx`: Efficient component for rendering large datasets with windowing and infinite scrolling.
    *   `src/components/LargeDataTable.jsx`: Example implementation showing how to manage large data collections with optimized processing.
*   **Interactions:**
    *   `FaceStorageService.js` now includes browser environment detection and direct Uint8Array handling for uploading images to S3, eliminating the need for Node.js Buffer in browser environments.
    *   `streamToString` helper function in `FaceStorageService.js` now supports both browser and Node.js streams for maximum compatibility.
    *   `VirtualizedList.jsx` renders only the visible portion of large lists, reducing DOM nodes and improving performance.
    *   Components with large datasets can use these utilities to maintain performance even with 1000+ items.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Browser-Compatible Image Handling:** 
        *   Direct runtime environment detection (`typeof window !== 'undefined' && typeof Buffer === 'undefined'`)
        *   Native Uint8Array usage for browser environments
        *   Support for all common image data formats (base64 strings, Blob, ArrayBuffer, Uint8Array)
        *   Fallback to Buffer only when running in Node.js or when available
    *   **Virtualization:** Only renders items visible in the viewport, significantly reducing render time and DOM size.
    *   **Incremental Rendering:** Processes and renders data in small batches to prevent UI freezing.
    *   **Infinite Scrolling:** Loads more data when user scrolls near the bottom of the list.
    *   **Optimized Processing:** Handles expensive item calculations off the main thread to maintain UI responsiveness.

## üìã Preprompt for AI Initialization (Cursor Rules / System Prompt)

```text
**Core Instructions for Shmong Project AI Assistant:**

1.  **MATRIX is Primary Context:** Your primary source of truth for project structure, data models, AWS usage, file interactions, and workflow is the `THE_MATRIX.md` file in the workspace root. Always consult it first before planning or acting.
2.  **Follow Standard Workflow:** Adhere strictly to the workflow defined in the `THE_MATRIX.md` section "Standard Development Workflow". Key steps include: MATRIX Scan -> Database Check (AWS CLI --no-paginate) -> Propose 3+ Plans -> User Approval -> Implement -> Deploy (`npm run deploy-auto`) -> Update MATRIX.
3.  **Database Interaction:** Before making DB-related changes, use AWS CLI (`--no-paginate`) to inspect the live DynamoDB schema (`shmong-face-data`) and confirm consistency. **Remember that `--no-paginate` is crucial to avoid interactive prompts.**
4.  **Safety First:** Prioritize making changes safely and carefully to avoid breaking the application. If unsure, ask clarifying questions or propose safer alternatives.
5.  **Automatic Documentation:** You are REQUIRED to automatically update `THE_MATRIX.md` (including the timestamp) within the same turn any relevant code, infrastructure, or process change is implemented.
6.  **Tool Usage:** Utilize available tools (file read/edit, terminal, search) effectively, following the defined workflow. Remember `--no-paginate` for AWS CLI **to ensure non-interactive output**.
7.  **Credentials:** Understand that AWS credentials are sourced from `.env` (details in MATRIX) but DO NOT ask for or handle the actual secret values. Focus on the configuration method.
```

- Face attributes are successfully stored in DynamoDB ‚úÖ
- Face images are correctly uploaded to S3 and public URLs stored ‚úÖ
- Dashboard successfully displays both face attributes and images ‚úÖ

**Technical Details:**
- Environment detection confirms "Browser=true, HasBuffer=false" at runtime
- Binary data is now handled with browser-native Uint8Array instead of Node.js Buffer
- All binary conversion operations use environment-specific code paths

This fix ensures the complete face registration flow works in browser environments, storing both the face attributes from Rekognition and the actual face image in S3 with proper public URLs.
