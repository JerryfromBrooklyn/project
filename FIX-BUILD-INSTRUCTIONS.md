# Instructions to Fix Build Issues

Your application is missing the correct package.json file and dependencies. Follow these steps to fix it:

## Option 1: Replace package.json

1. Rename the existing package.json:
   ```
   ren package.json lambda-package.json
   ```

2. Rename the new package.json file:
   ```
   ren app-package.json package.json
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Option 2: Use the batch file

1. Run the batch file we created:
   ```
   install-dependencies.bat
   ```
   This will install the necessary dependencies and start the server automatically.

## Testing the Lambda Auth Integration

Once your application is running, test the signup process to verify Lambda auth integration:

1. Navigate to the signup page
2. Fill in the form with test credentials
3. Submit the form

The request should go through the API Gateway to your Lambda function, which will create a user in your Cognito User Pool.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **CORS errors**: Make sure your API Gateway has CORS enabled
2. **Connection errors**: Check the Lambda function logs in CloudWatch
3. **Auth errors**: Verify that the Cognito User Pool ID and Client ID are correct

Your Lambda function is properly configured to create users in Cognito, so once the application builds correctly, the auth flow should work as expected.
