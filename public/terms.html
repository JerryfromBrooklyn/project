        <blockquote><strong>In Plain Language:</strong> If we have a disagreement about these Terms, we'll resolve it through arbitration (a private dispute resolution process) instead of going to court. The only exception is if either of us needs immediate court help to stop ongoing harm.</blockquote>
        <p>6.2. <strong>Arbitration Process.</strong> Arbitration shall be conducted in Delaware, pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) or JAMS. The arbitration award will be final and binding.</p>
        <p>6.3. <strong>Opt-Out Option.</strong> You have the right to opt out of arbitration by notifying SHMONG in writing at Legal@shmong.com, or sending written notice to our Delaware address within 60 days of accepting these Terms.

The written notice must clearly state your intent to opt out of arbitration.</p>
        <blockquote><strong>In Plain Language:</strong> You can choose not to participate in arbitration if you tell us in writing within 60 days of agreeing to these terms. If you opt out, any disputes would go through regular courts instead.</blockquote>
        <p>6.4. <strong>Class Action Waiver.</strong> You agree that disputes will be resolved on an individual basis only, not as part of a class action. You waive any right to participate in class actions.</p>
        <blockquote><strong>In Plain Language:</strong> By using our service, you agree to handle any disputes with us one-on-one, not as part of a group lawsuit.</blockquote>

        <h2>9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>
        <p>9.1. <strong>"AS IS" Basis.</strong> THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE," WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND.</p>
        <p>9.2. <strong>Limitation of Liability.</strong> TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, SHMONG SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES.</p>

This limitation applies regardless of the basis of any liability claim and regardless of the form of action.</p>
        <blockquote><strong>In Plain Language:</strong> If something goes wrong, we'll only be responsible for refunding what you've paid us in the past year. This limit applies no matter what type of legal claim might be involved.</blockquote>
