        <!-- BIOMETRICS POLICY CONTENT START -->
        <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
        <p>This Biometrics Policy governs how we collect, use, store, and protect biometric data. We collect biometric identifiers like facial geometry only with your explicit consent for specific purposes, such as face matching services. We implement strong security measures to protect this sensitive data and provide you with rights to access, delete, or withdraw consent for your biometric information. Special provisions apply based on your state or country of residence.</p>
        
        <h2>1. BIOMETRIC DATA COLLECTION AND CONSENT</h2>
        <p>1.1. <strong>Collection Authorization.</strong> SHMONG maintains a publicly available written policy detailing retention schedules and destruction guidelines for Biometric Data. By accepting this Agreement, you consent to the collection, storage, use, and processing of your Biometric Data (e.g., facial geometry, templates, vectors derived from your Content).</p>
        <p>1.2. <strong>Specific Biometric Identifiers Collected.</strong> SHMONG explicitly collects and processes the following biometric identifiers:</p>
        <ul>
           <li>Facial geometry and landmarks</li>
           <li>Facial measurement vectors and templates</li>
           <li>Facial recognition data points</li>
           <li>Mathematical representations of facial features</li>
           <li>Other facial biometric data necessary for our facial recognition technology</li>
        </ul>
        <p>1.3. <strong>Commercial Data Usage.</strong> By accepting this Agreement, you expressly authorize SHMONG to:</p>
        <ul>
           <li>Sell, trade, share, and commercially use your biometric data</li>
           <li>Generate revenue from insights derived from biometric data</li>
           <li>License biometric data to third parties for commercial purposes</li>
           <li>Create and monetize products based on biometric data</li>
           <li>Transfer or assign rights to biometric data as part of business operations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By accepting this Agreement, you explicitly consent to these commercial activities. We may engage in these commercial activities while maintaining reasonable security measures for your data as outlined in this Agreement.</p>
        <p>1.4. <strong>Rights Waiver.</strong> By accepting this Agreement, you acknowledge and agree to waive the following rights regarding your biometric data:</p>
        <ul>
           <li>The right to revoke consent for historical data usage that has already been incorporated into our systems</li>
           <li>The right to restrict certain forms of processing necessary for core service functionality</li>
           <li>The right to object to legitimate commercial usage as permitted by applicable law and described in this Policy</li>
           <li>The right to disable certain security features that rely on biometric authentication</li>
           <li>Any rights beyond those explicitly granted in this Agreement or required by applicable law</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You retain all other rights not explicitly waived, including those detailed in Section 3 of this Biometrics Policy, and your right to opt-out as described in Section 1.5 remains unaffected by this waiver.</p>
        <p>1.5. <strong>Opt-Out Procedure.</strong> You may opt out of biometric data collection, processing, and commercial usage at any time by:</p>
        <ul>
           <li>Emailing a clear request to <a href="mailto:Legal@shmong.com">Legal@shmong.com</a> with the subject line "Biometric Data Opt-Out"</li>
           <li>Including your account information and specific opt-out request details</li>
           <li>Verifying your identity through our standard verification process</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Upon receipt of a verified opt-out request, SHMONG will:</p>
        <ul>
           <li>Cease collecting new biometric data within 10 business days</li>
           <li>Delete existing biometric data within 45 days (subject to legal retention requirements)</li>
           <li>Confirm completion of your opt-out request</li>
           <li>Note that opting out may limit or disable certain features that rely on biometric data</li>
        </ul>
        <p>1.6. <strong>Uploader Responsibility.</strong> If you upload content containing other individuals, you are solely and exclusively responsible for obtaining their written consent, notifying them of this policy, and documenting their acceptance as specified in the Terms of Service. SHMONG's role is limited to requiring uploaders to certify they have obtained proper consent before uploading biometric data.</p>
        <p>1.7. <strong>Certification of Consent by Uploaders.</strong> Before uploading any Content containing biometric data of other individuals, you must certify that:</p>
        <ul>
           <li>You have obtained express, informed written consent from each identifiable individual</li>
           <li>You have informed these individuals that their biometric data will be processed by SHMONG</li>
           <li>You maintain verifiable records of these consents</li>
           <li>You take full legal responsibility for the consent collection process</li>
           <li>You will indemnify SHMONG against any claims arising from inadequate consent</li>
        </ul>
        <p>1.8. <strong>Mandatory Certification Checkbox.</strong> SHMONG implements a mandatory certification process requiring uploaders to affirmatively check a box before each upload containing biometric data, specifically certifying they have obtained all necessary consents. This checkbox is non-optional, and uploads cannot proceed without this certification. SHMONG maintains records of these certifications, including timestamps and user information. However, SHMONG does not independently verify the actual consent documents and relies entirely on uploader certifications.</p>
        <p>1.9. <strong>SHMONG's Limited Role in Consent Process.</strong> SHMONG's role regarding consent is limited to:</p>
        <ul>
           <li>Requiring uploaders to certify they have obtained proper consent</li>
           <li>Providing uploaders with information about consent requirements</li>
           <li>Establishing a mechanism for certification during the upload process</li>
           <li>Maintaining records of uploader certifications</li>
        </ul>
        <p>SHMONG does not verify the actual consent documents obtained by uploaders and relies entirely on uploader certifications regarding consent.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>In Plain Language:</strong> If you upload photos of other people to our service:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You must check a box confirming you have their permission</li>
                <li>You are responsible for actually getting their written permission</li>
                <li>We keep a record of your certification but don't check the actual permission forms</li>
                <li>We trust that when you check the box, you've truly gotten proper permission</li>
                <li>You are legally responsible if you upload someone's face without proper permission</li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <p>1.10. <strong>Consent Verification and Audit Program.</strong> To ensure the integrity of our consent certification system:</p>
        <ul>
           <li>SHMONG conducts periodic random audits of uploader consent records to verify compliance</li>
           <li>Selected uploaders must provide verifiable evidence of proper consent within 10 business days</li>
           <li>Uploaders agree to participate in these audits as a condition of using our Services</li>
           <li>Audits will assess both the existence and validity of consent records</li>
           <li>SHMONG will maintain detailed records of all audit processes and findings</li>
           <li>Audit frequency will be determined based on risk assessment and usage volume</li>
        </ul>
        <p>1.11. <strong>Consequences of Audit Failure.</strong> Failure to comply with audit requirements or discovery of consent violations may result in:</p>
        <ul>
           <li>Immediate account suspension pending investigation</li>
           <li>Permanent account termination for serious or repeated violations</li>
           <li>Removal of all Content uploaded without proper consent documentation</li>
           <li>Prohibition from creating new accounts on the platform</li>
           <li>Potential reporting to relevant regulatory authorities</li>
           <li>Legal action for indemnification as provided in the Terms of Service</li>
           <li>Additional remedial measures as required to ensure compliance</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>In Plain Language:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>We will randomly check if uploaders actually have the permission forms they claimed to have</li>
                <li>If selected for audit, you must show us the permission documents within 10 business days</li>
                <li>If you can't prove you had permission or you've falsely claimed to have permission, we may suspend or terminate your account, remove your content, ban you from our platform, report you to authorities, and/or take legal action against you</li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>
        
        <h2>2. STORAGE AND PROTECTION</h2>
        <p>2.1. <strong>Duration of Storage.</strong> We retain Biometric Data until the earliest of:</p>
        <ul>
           <li>For Texas residents, not later than the first anniversary of the date the purpose for collecting the identifier expires</li>
           <li>For Illinois residents, when the initial purpose for collecting or obtaining such identifiers or information has been satisfied or within 3 years of the individual's last interaction, whichever occurs first</li>
           <li>For residents of other states, three (3) years after last interaction</li>
           <li>Your deletion request fulfillment</li>
           <li>Failure to provide re-consent</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>In Plain Language:</strong> We'll keep biometric data until:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>For Texas residents: for no more than 1 year after we no longer need it</li>
                <li>For Illinois residents: until we no longer need it or for 3 years after last activity, whichever happens first</li>
                <li>For other states: for up to 3 years after last activity</li>
                <li>Earlier if you ask us to delete it or don't renew your consent when asked</li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <p>2.2. <strong>Security Standards.</strong> We store, transmit, and protect Biometric Data using a reasonable standard of care within our industry, at least as protective as how we handle other confidential information. Measures include:</p>

           <li>Access controls</li>
           <li>Security assessments</li>
           <li>Personnel training</li>
           <li>Physical security</li>
           <li>Data segregation</li>
           <li>Timely breach notification</li>
        </ul>
        <p>2.3. <strong>Periodic Re-Consent.</strong> To comply with laws and maintain accuracy, periodic re-consent (at least every 24 months) is required for continued storage/use of Biometric Data.</p>

        <ul>
           <li><strong>Uploader Responsibility</strong>: As an uploader, you are solely responsible for all legal compliance related to biometric data consent, notification, and record-keeping. You must:
              <ul>
                 <li>Establish a clear process for individuals in your Content to request removal</li>
                 <li>Collect sufficient information to verify identity</li>
                 <li>Maintain an immutable log of all removal requests for 3 years</li>
                 <li>Bear sole legal responsibility for any claims related to consent or improper collection</li>
                 <li>Indemnify SHMONG for any claims arising from your uploaded Content</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
           <li><strong>SHMONG Technical Role</strong>: Upon receiving a verified removal request (either directly or from an uploader), SHMONG will:
              <ul>
                 <li>Execute the technical removal of biometric data from SHMONG systems</li>
                 <li>Complete removal within 30 calendar days from verification</li>
                 <li>Provide confirmation of technical deletion</li>
                 <li>Notify relevant service providers processing this data</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
           <li><strong>Limited Technical Role Disclaimer</strong>: SHMONG's execution of technical deletion does not in any way assume, transfer, or share the uploader's sole legal responsibility for consent collection, notification requirements, or compliance with biometric privacy laws. The uploader acknowledges and agrees they remain solely legally accountable for all consent-related matters regardless of who executes the technical deletion.</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>In Plain Language:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>If someone wants their face data removed, they can ask you (the uploader) or us directly</li>
                <li>If asked, we'll delete their data within 30 days and confirm when it's done</li>
                <li>Even though we'll delete the data when requested, uploaders remain fully responsible for having gotten proper permission in the first place</li>
                <li>As an uploader, you need to have your own process for handling removal requests</li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>
        
        <h2>4. DATA SHARING LIMITATIONS</h2>
