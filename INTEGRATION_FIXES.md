# Integration Fixes

This document provides an overview of the fixes applied to ensure proper integration between the frontend, backend, and AWS services.

## Authentication Fixes

The authentication system has been fixed to ensure proper sign-in and sign-up functionality:

1. Enhanced Supabase client configuration with proper session handling
2. Added robust error handling for auth operations
3. Ensured proper session persistence and token refresh
4. Fixed missing auth state change listeners

## Face Registration Fixes

The face registration system now works correctly with the following improvements:

1. Fixed database structure to properly store face IDs
2. Created synchronization between different face storage tables
3. Added redundant storage mechanisms to prevent data loss
4. Enhanced error handling in the face indexing service
5. Improved face detection confidence scoring

## Historical Face Matching Fixes

Face matching now works for both past and future photos:

1. Added database functions to fix historical face matches
2. Created triggers to automatically match faces in new photos
3. Enhanced the face matching algorithm to be more reliable
4. Fixed issues with face ID format inconsistencies
5. Added batch processing for face match corrections

## Photo Display Fixes

The photos tab now correctly displays all user photos with proper metadata:

1. Fixed issues with photo metadata storage
2. Enhanced photo retrieval with proper face recognition
3. Added backup mechanisms for photo metadata
4. Fixed permission issues for photo access
5. Optimized queries for faster photo loading

## How to Apply Fixes

### Windows

Run the `apply_fixes.bat` script in the project root:

```
.\apply_fixes.bat
```

### Linux/macOS

Run the `apply_fixes.sh` script in the project root:

```
chmod +x ./apply_fixes.sh
./apply_fixes.sh
```

## Verifying Fixes

After applying the fixes, ensure that:

1. Users can sign in and sign up properly
2. Face registration works during onboarding
3. Previously uploaded photos now show matched faces
4. New photo uploads correctly identify faces
5. The photos tab displays all photos correctly

## Architectural Improvements

These fixes also include architectural improvements:

1. Better separation of concerns between services
2. Enhanced error handling and logging
3. Redundant storage for critical data
4. Performance optimizations for large datasets
5. Improved synchronization between frontend and backend

## AWS Integration

AWS integration has been fixed with:

1. Proper AWS credential handling
2. Enhanced error handling for AWS service calls
3. Automatic retry mechanisms for transient failures
4. Better logging of AWS operations
5. Fallbacks for when AWS services are unavailable
